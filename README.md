**### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Matteo

I'm an electronics engineering student and developer passionate about embedded systems, network protocols (SOAP, HTTP, TCP/UDP), and church media technology.

ðŸ”§ At work, I maintain projects involving backend communication layers and promote the use of Proxmox for virtualization.

ðŸŽ¸ In my spare time, I develop tools to streamline worship services, like converters for OpenLP â†’ ProPresenter.

ðŸ’¡ I enjoy building things that solve real problems using C and C#.
